ParaDiS Public Release 2.5.1:
-----------------------------

The primary changes between the version 2.3.5 and version
2.5.1 releases of ParaDiS are as follows:

    - Two alternative FCC mobility functions ("FCC_0b" and "FCC_climb") have
      been added.  See section 7.2 of the ParaDiS User's Guide for a brief
      description of these mobility modules.

    - The flux decomposition code has been reworked and extended to
      support FCC materials.

    - A new 'predictive' collision handling method has been introduced
      into the code, replacing the old 'proximity' method as the default.
      However, the proximity method can still be selected at run time via
      the "collisionMethod" control file parameter.  Additionally, the
      proximity collision handling was modified to improve selection of
      collision points when planar mobilities are in use, and handling of
      'hinge' collisions was rewritten to fix some bugs.

    - The mesh coarsening functions were modified to allow
      nodes with multiple glide constraints to be coarsened
      out under specific circumstances.  Primarily needed
      for use with planar mobility functions.

    - Incorporated modifications (based on code from Bing Liu
      and others at the Max-Planck-Institut fur Eisenforschung)
      to support rotation from a laboratory frame to the
      crystalographic frame.  (See <useLabFrame>, <labFrameXDir>,
      <labFrameYDir> and <labFrameZDir> control file parameters.)

    - The cross-slip functions were significantly modified.  Changes
      included introduction of a threshold which cross-slip stress must
      exceed before a cross-slip event is attempted.  Adding the ability
      to cross-slip immovable nodes if they are already in perfect
      position.  Removing the ability to cross-slip a node onto a third
      plane for two segments on different planes.  Adding checks to
      verify that a cross-slip nucleus will continue moving outward
      into the cross-slip plane before committing to the cross-slip event,
      and adding a check to prevent cross-slip 'zipper' events if the
      segment forces contra-indicate the necessity.

    - Extended code for selecting an appropriate glide plane for new
      screw segments to support FCC materials as well as BCC.

    - Modified generation of the control parameter file to
      write out only those parameters appropriate to the
      simulation being run, and those explicitly provided by
      the user.

    - Code was added to force newly created segments (regardless of
      whether segments were screw or not) onto exact glide planes
      rather than calculate glide planes from l cross b which allowed
      small glide plane discrepancies to creep into the simulation.
      Note: this is only enabled with planar mobility functions such
      as BCC_glide or the FCC mobilities.

    - Added support for writing nodal and segment data formatted
      for use with the VisIt visualization tool.  Also added support for
      periodically writing output files containing node specific forces.
      See sections 12.7 and 13.5 in the ParaDiS User's Guide for more
      information.

    - Removed all support for the obsolete TeraScale Browser
      visualization tool.

    - Various small bug fixes, code cleanup, documentation updates, etc.

    - Note: some preliminary work on adding threading via OpenMP
      has been done, however, this effort is not yet complete
      and is not yet fully supported.



ParaDiS Public Release 2.3.5:
-----------------------------

The primary changes to the public version of ParaDiS since
the version 2.2.6 release are as follows:

    - Added a new BCC mobility function (BCC_glide) which enforces
      dislocation motion along associated glide-planes, along with
      a mechanism to allow cross-slip in BCC.

    - The obsolete FCC_2 mobility function has been removed, while
      the FCC_0 mobility and an asscoiated cross-slip function have
      been added (thanks to our collaborators at Stanford University).

    - Creation of prismatic loops via paradisgen utility has been
      completely redone to properly generate vacancy or interstitial
      loops.  Additionally a mechanism for creating initial configurations
      that are edge (well, not pure edge) rather than screw has been
      added to paradisgen.

    - Added optional osmotic force calculations into the code.

    - Numerous bug were fixed, including several significant bugs:
      * If the Rijm* tables was used for far-field forces rather than
        using FMM, one of the Rijm* tables was incorrectly distributed
        for multi-processor runs.
      * Cell IDs were not being set properly for secondary ghost nodes.
      * The FMM code was not properly accounting for a conditional
        convergence issue (again, thanks to our Stanford friends for
        identifying and fixing this problem).

    - The Recursive Bisection (type 2) domain decomposition has been
      modified to remove the restriction that the number of domains
      per dimension be a power of 2.

    - A variety of small changes were added to improve support for
      a local finite-element code with hooks into ParaDiS, and
      to support new mobility functions that are more dependent
      on dislocation glide-planes.

    - A great deal of code cleanup was done, including removing
      obsolete prototypes, functions, and variables,  adding some
      missing prototypes and fixing minor mismatches between
      function parameters and prototypes, makefile tweaks, adding
      or removing debug code as appropriate, and so on.
      compiler

There were also a few internal changes that might be of interest to
anyone modifying their own copies of the code.  These changes include:

    - The memory management in the FMM code was altered to be
      less bloated for large simulations.  This did involve some
      structure changes and changes to the cell lookup mechanism.
      The EncodeIndex() function in the FMM code was also renamed
      to EncodeFMMCellIndex() for clarity

    - Added each cell's per-dimension indices to the cell structure
      and modified code (where possible) to use those indices rather
      than convert the cell ID to indices. 

    - The NodeForce() and PartialForces() functions were merged
      in order to help simplify things a little.

    - Nodal constraint values that were previously hard-coded througout
      the source have been replaced with compile-time definitions; again
      for clarity.

    - Calls to the SplitNode() function now have an additional argument
      that was needed for improved support for a local FEM code.


ParaDiS Public Release 2.2.6:
-----------------------------

The list below briefly describes most of the updates that have
been included into ParaDiS.v2.2.6:

    - There were minor changes to the format of FMM correction table.
      IMPORTANT: Although correction tables generated with previous
      versions of ParaDiS are still supported, a correction table
      generated with version 2.2.6 cannot be used with earlier
      versions of the code.

    - Added 'calcdensity' utility for generating density field
      output from a restart file.

    - A new 'properties' output file has been added for reporting
      incremental density changes by burgers vector.  See section
      13.2.2.7 in the docs/ParaDiSInfo.txt for details.

    - Added optional inertial terms to the BCC_0 mobility module.  
      Option is enabled via the <includeInertia> and <massDensity>
      control file parameters.  See parameter descriptions in
      the docs/ParaDiSInfo.txt file.
      
    - Added modifications from the Stanford folks, including
      code to do full n^2 forces (serial only), a new line tension
      model, and minor bug fixes in writing properties output.

    - Code modifications to allow mixtures of periodic bounds and
      free surfaces, plus modifications to 'paradisgen' to handle
      mixed boundary conditions for certain config types.  This
      is primarily for users coupling ParaDiS coupled with a
      Finite Element code, since use of free surfaces is not fully
      supported without this coupling.

    - Various small bug fixes, commentation changes, and code cleanup.


ParaDiS Public Release 2.2.5:
-----------------------------

The public release of version 2.2.5  of ParaDiS contains a variety
of updates to the 2.2.3 version.  The list below briefly describes
most of the updates that have been included into ParaDiS.v2.2.5:


    - For multi-processor simulations, the total force on some segments
      was summed to incorrectly include duplicated segment/segment
      interactions.

    - Minor updates to the force calculations for near-parallel segments

    - Both collision handling and remesh contained a bug which could result
      in bad nodal force estimates for the nodes involved in certain segment
      interactions.

    - Collision handling code was fixed to prevent throwing nodes long
      distances when the colliding segment planes are near parallel.

    - The mechanism for recalculating force/velocity on nodes that have been
      involved in collisions or other topological events has been redesigned
      to utilize the same code used for the full force calculations in order
      to ensure more accurate force/velocity values at the start of a
      timestep.

    - Previously, forces between any given pair of segments were calculated
      in one processor and communicated to neighboring processors as
      necessary.  Now, all segment forces are calculated only once and
      communicated using the same mechanism.

    - A problem with the ability to do parallel I/O on restart files and
      subsequently restart with different domain geometries was fixed.

    - A binary restart file capability has been reintroduced into ParaDiS.

    - Minor bug fixes, code cleanup, and documentation updates.



ParaDiS Public Release 2.2.3:
-----------------------------

The public release of version 2.2.3  of ParaDiS contains a variety
of updates to the 2.2 version.  A number of the updates are small
but there are a few significant changes and several very important
fixes.  The list below briefly describes most of the updates that
have been included into ParaDiS.v2.2.3:


    - Several important errors related to the calculation of remote
      forces via the FMM code were fixed:

        + The code for generating the FMM image correction table has
          been fixed to replace an incorrect algorithm that was inadvertently
          introduced into ParaDiS.v2.2.

          IMPORTANT! Due to this change, all FMM image correction tables
                     must be rebuilt with this new release.  The default
                     correction table supplied with this release has
                     be regenerated with correct values.

        + An inconsistency in the way FMM remote forces were calculated for
          some segments crossing cell boundaries has been corrected.

        + A bug, which resulted in an incorrect list of neighboring
          cells while setting taylor expansion coefficients during the
          FMM downward pass, has been corrected.

    - The original parallel design of ParaDiS had a flaw which allowed the
      code to 'miss' some of the needed local segment-to-segment force
      calculations.  Code has been added to communicate a layer of 'secondary
      ghost nodes' in order to insure all needed local force calculations are
      be done.

    - Minor updates to the force calculations for near-parallel segments

    - The problem generator has been modified to allow creation of frank-read
      sources, and has changes to speed up the creation of very large
      problems.

    - Added code to create 'fragment' files containing dislocation line
      fragment information in a format that can be used with the ViSIt
      visualization tool.

    - Added various sanity checks during code initialization for such things
      as insuring conservation of burger's vector, consistency of burgers
      vector at both ends of a segment, and so on.

    - Minor bug fixes, code cleanup, and documentation updates.
