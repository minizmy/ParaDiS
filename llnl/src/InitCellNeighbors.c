 *
 *      Function:    InitCellNeighbors
 *      Description: For each native cell in domain, find all its neighbor
 *                   cells. If a neighbor cell has already been encountered
 *                   and allocated, just add its cell index to the native
 *                   cell's list of neighbors. If this is the first time,
 *                   allocate it and add it to home->cellList and
 *                   home->cellKeys, as well as to the native node's
 *                   neighbor list.
 *
 *                   If periodic boundaries are turned on and a neighbor
 *                   cell lies outside the base problem space, a cell is
 *                   allocated for the periodic image cell, but the cell
 *                   only contains offsets to apply to the corresponding
 *                   base cell, and a pointer to the base cell, which is
 *                   also allocated even if it isn't used by domain except
 *                   in shifted form. Only the base cell is added to
 *                   home->cellList
