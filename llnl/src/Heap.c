 *      Module:       Heap.c
 *      Description:  Contains functions for maintaining an integer "heap".
 *                    The heap is a binary tree. The rule for a heap is
 *                    that the value of a cell is greater than or equal
 *                    to the value of its parent cell. This applies
 *                    recursively throughout the tree (heap). This ensures
 *                    that the smallest number is in the root cell. 
 *                    This tree is stored in a linear array such that
 *                    the children of any element k are located at
 *                    elements 2k+1 and 2k+2.
 *
 *                    To add an element, one can put it at the end of
 *                    the array (which would mean adding a new node at
 *                    the bottom of the tree). At this point the heap rule
 *                    may not be fulfilled. If one element was changed
 *                    or added, it is only around that element that the rule
 *                    can be broken. So we can compare the value of the new
 *                    node to that if its parent. If the rule is not
 *                    fulfilled, we swap them. If we made a swap, we
 *                    recursively apply the same test to the parent node and
 *                    possible switch. If no swap is made, the heap condition
 *                    is fulfilled everywhere and we are done. If we reach
 *                    the root node, we are done, since the root node has no
 *                    parent, and the heap condition is fullfilled everywhere
 *                    below. This process is called bubble up, since an added
 *                    small value will wiggle its way upward like a bubble in
 *                    water.
 *
 *                    If the top element is removed, we have an empty spot
 *                    in the array that needs to be filled. The simplest way
 *                    is to take the last element and put it in the empty
 *                    first spot. Then a bubble down is performed. Here a
 *                    cell value is compared to its children values, and if
 *                    a childs value is smaller, a swap is made, and the
 *                    process continues recursively downward
 *
 *      Functions:
 *          BubbleDown()
 *          BubbleUp()
 *          HeapAdd()
 *          HeapInit()
 *          HeapRemove()
